# Template project to use RequireJS and Angular ui router

TODO:

- maybe change webserver to [connect](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/gulp-as-a-development-web-server--cms-20903)
- ui-router reloading problem -> don't know why it doesn't work, cannot find good resolution for this problem, maybe should debug ui-router
- create more "common" views as sample structure
- create some gulp tasks to minimize, require-inject ,optimize, uglifize files
- maybe create module factory to prevent boilerplate
